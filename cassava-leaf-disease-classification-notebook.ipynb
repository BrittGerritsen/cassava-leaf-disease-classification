(https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)\n","\n","As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root. Unfortunately viral diseases are a major source of poor yields. With the help of Data Science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated. Our dataset consists of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Our goal is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With our help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.037375,"end_time":"2020-11-19T21:45:23.192515","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-19T21:45:23.15514","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Set up environment\n","## Load libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-24T12:34:13.153913Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-24T12:34:13.153326Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-24T12:35:51.460494Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-24T12:35:51.459009Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-24T12:34:13.153877Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install --upgrade tensorflow"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-24T12:40:48.558288Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-24T12:40:48.557852Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-24T12:40:52.971506Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-24T12:40:52.970080Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-24T12:40:48.558252Z"},"papermill":{"duration":6.890298,"end_time":"2020-11-19T21:45:30.119979","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-19T21:45:23.229681","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# System related imports\n","import math, re, os, warnings\n","\n","# Data manipulation\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import json\n","import shutil\n","\n","# Visualization imports\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib import gridspec\n","\n","# Deep learning framework\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from kaggle_datasets import KaggleDatasets\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from functools import partial\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import tensorflow_hub as hub\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from tensorflow.keras import preprocessing\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental import preprocessing\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers\n","from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n","tf.config.optimizer.set_jit(True)\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image_dataset_from_directory\n","from tensorflow.keras import regularizers\n","import cv2\n","\n","# Validation\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","\n","# Check if tensorflow is updated\n","print(\"Tensorflow version \" + tf.__version__)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-24T12:40:56.155652Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-24T12:40:56.155192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-24T12:40:56.162493Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-24T12:40:56.161295Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-24T12:40:56.155614Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Set Matplotlib defaults\n","plt.rc('figure', autolayout=True)\n","plt.rc('axes', labelweight='bold', labelsize='large',\n","       titleweight='bold', titlesize=18, titlepad=10)\n","plt.rc('image', cmap='magma')\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Place images in the right folders\n","\n","Because we are unable to manipulate the images from the input folders directly, we will transfer them to new folders in the output, sorted by their class.
